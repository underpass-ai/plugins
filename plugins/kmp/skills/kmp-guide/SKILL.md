# KMP guide

Resolve the plugin root as two directories above this `SKILL.md`.

Run `<plugin-root>/scripts/kmp-guide-sync.sh sync`. This is the lifecycle
verb: it deterministically converges `guide:kmp-agent` and `guide:kmp` to the
content shipped with the installed plugin. It is safe after first setup, after
an update and on an already-current store.

The guides are different:

- `guide:kmp-agent` is for the agent. Wake it and use its verb entries as an
  operational glossary: when to use the verb, when not to, minimum input,
  expected result and usual next move. Its exact tool descriptions are
  generated from the installed engine's live `tools/list`.
- `guide:kmp` is for the person. Do not paste or paraphrase the whole guide
  into chat; open it visually.

After sync, call `kmp_wake` on `guide:kmp-agent`. Read the packet before
explaining or demonstrating KMP. If the packet is unexpectedly empty, report
that guide sync did not become visible to this MCP process; do not invent the
guide from repository prose.

Then perform `open:guide`:

1. Call `kmp_view_open` once with `about: "guide:kmp"`.
2. Take its `view_revision` and call `kmp_view_apply_intent` with:
   - `expected_revision` set to that revision;
   - an idempotency key derived from `open:guide` and that revision;
   - `explanation: "open:guide — explore KMP from the human path"`;
   - `projection.semantic_zoom: "atlas"`;
   - `projection.dimensions: ["audience", "depth"]`;
   - `selection: "guide:kmp:welcome"`.
3. Call `kmp_view_get_state` before continuing and hand the returned
   capability URL to the person.

If another participant moved the loom first, get state and rebase the intent
on the new revision. Never retry blind and never reopen the view merely to
navigate it.

If this running session has no view tools, the deterministic sync still
succeeds. Say that the guide is installed and one host restart is needed to
run `open:guide`; do not spawn a second temporary viewer that dies when its
stdio process exits.

Keep the handoff compact. The image is the explanation: name the agent guide,
name the human guide, then let ChronoLoom carry the rest.
