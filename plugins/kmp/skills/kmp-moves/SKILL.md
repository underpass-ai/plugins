# KMP moves

Prefer the live `tools/list` result. Its ten memory tools must expose exactly:
`kmp_ingest`, `kmp_write_memory`, `kmp_wake`, `kmp_ask`, `kmp_goto`,
`kmp_near`, `kmp_rewind`, `kmp_forward`, `kmp_trace`, and `kmp_inspect`.
Its three semantic view tools are `kmp_view_open`,
`kmp_view_apply_intent`, and `kmp_view_get_state`.

Group them as entry (`wake`, semantic `ask`), time (`goto`, `near`, `rewind`,
`forward`), audit (`trace`, `inspect`), and write (`write_memory`, low-level
`ingest`), with the view tools controlling ChronoLoom's semantic state. Use
`tools/list` as the authority for relation vocabulary. State that temporal
intent uses the time group before semantic Ask.
