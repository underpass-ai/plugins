description: Catch up on an about — what changed since you last looked, from the event log rather than from re-reading files

Answer one question: **what happened here since I last looked?**

The arguments are optional. `$1` is the about; with none, use the about this
work belongs to, and if that is ambiguous, ask rather than guess. `$2` is the
point to catch up from — a timestamp, or a phrase like "yesterday" you resolve
to one.

This is temporal intent. Resolve the user's timezone and turn a bounded
calendar period into a half-open UTC interval `[start, end)`. Do not call
`kmp_ask`; Ask is semantic relevance retrieval, not an interval query.
Because `kmp_forward` is strictly after its cursor, capture the inclusive
start boundary with `kmp_goto` at `start` and keep only entries exactly at
that time. Then move forward from `start`, merge and deduplicate refs, and
exclude entries at or after `end`.

## Without a `since`

Find the frontier first, then decide.

1. `kmp_rewind` with `from: { time: <now> }`, `limit: { entries: 1 }` and
   `budget: { detail: "full" }`. The newest entry comes back with its
   `coordinates[].observed_at`. That is when this memory was last written,
   and `page.total` is how much it holds.
2. If that timestamp is older than the work in front of you, there is nothing
   to catch up on — say so in one line and stop. Do not pad.
3. Otherwise use it as the anchor and report what the memory says now, via
   `kmp_wake`.

## With a `since`

`kmp_forward` with `from: { time: <since> }` and
`budget: { detail: "full" }` returns exactly the entries after that moment,
in order, with their coordinates. `page.has_more` tells you whether the slice
was cut. Follow `page.next_cursor` through `from.ref`, keeping other arguments
unchanged, until the exclusive end bound is reached. If a cap prevents that,
report the exact continuation rather than presenting a partial list as the
whole delta.

For anything that changed a decision — a `contradicts`, a `supersedes`, a
`corrects` — follow it with `kmp_inspect` and report what it replaced. That
is the part a file diff cannot tell them.

## Reporting

Lead with the count and the span: *"Four entries since Friday 14:00."* Then
the entries, newest first, each in one line: what it is, and if it changed
something earlier, what it changed.

Close with the cursor they can reuse:

> Next time: `kmp_forward` from `<newest observed_at>`.

Two things to get right. **If the memory is empty or the about does not
exist**, say exactly that — an empty memory is not a failure, it is the signal
that nothing has been written here yet. And **never fill a quiet delta with
narration**: "nothing has changed since Friday" is a complete answer and the
most useful one when it is true.

**Say it in the house voice.** One line per thing, and detail only where
something needs it. The fix goes next to the problem, never in a footer. Close
with a verdict in plain words and at most one next command.

Write it young, fresh and a little freak: short sentences, present tense,
talking to the person rather than reporting on the software. No emoji soup,
and never a joke inside a failure. If the personality costs an extra line, cut
the personality.
