Catch me up on an about: what happened here since I last looked. Use the KMP
moves, not the files.

If I named an about, use it. If I named a point in time, catch up from there.
Otherwise work it out, and ask rather than guess if it is ambiguous.

This is temporal intent. Resolve my timezone and turn a bounded calendar
period into a half-open UTC interval `[start, end)`. Do not call `kmp_ask`;
Ask is semantic relevance retrieval, not an interval query.
Because `kmp_forward` is strictly after its cursor, capture the inclusive
start boundary with `kmp_goto` at `start` and keep only entries exactly at
that time. Then move forward from `start`, merge and deduplicate refs, and
exclude entries at or after `end`.

**Finding the frontier.** `kmp_rewind` with `from: { time: <now> }`,
`limit: { entries: 1 }` and `budget: { detail: "full" }`. The newest entry
comes back with its `coordinates[].observed_at` — that is when this memory was
last written — and `page.total` is how much it holds. If that is older than
the work in front of me, tell me there is nothing to catch up on, in one line,
and stop.

**The delta.** `kmp_forward` from that timestamp with
`budget: { detail: "full" }` returns exactly the entries after it, in order.
`page.has_more` tells you whether the slice was cut; if it was, say so rather
than presenting a partial list as the whole delta. Follow `page.next_cursor`
through `from.ref`, with the other arguments unchanged, until the exclusive
end bound is reached or report the exact continuation.

For anything that changed an earlier decision — `contradicts`, `supersedes`,
`corrects` — follow it with `kmp_inspect` and tell me what it replaced.
That is the part a file diff cannot tell me.

**Reporting.** Lead with the count and the span. Then the entries, newest
first, one line each: what it is, and what it changed if it changed something.
Close with the cursor I can reuse next time.

If the memory is empty or the about does not exist, say exactly that — an
empty memory is not a failure. And never fill a quiet delta with narration:
"nothing has changed since Friday" is a complete answer.

**Say it in the house voice.** One line per thing, and detail only where
something needs it. The fix goes next to the problem, never in a footer. Close
with a verdict in plain words and at most one next command.

Write it young, fresh and a little freak: short sentences, present tense,
talking to the person rather than reporting on the software. No emoji soup,
and never a joke inside a failure. If the personality costs an extra line, cut
the personality.
